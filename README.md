- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rodrigo.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m VERY interested in Front-End Development and UI Design :)

- ðŸš€ On the road to becoming an EXPERT in the development and design of interfaces.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently improving my skills in React.js and Next.js.


## My career so far

- I have a degree in Electrical Engineering, and I am currently working as a maintenance planning analyst in a mining industry. However, I came to the conclusion that this is not what I want for my life, so I'm using the free time to study what I like the most: programming (more specifically front end development).

- At university, however, I did an internship as a web developer for 1 year (basically using HTML, CSS, Django and MySQL).

- Later, I did an internship as a graphic designer at a marketing agency. I really like UI design!

- I am putting my efforts into this career change. My goal is to get a job as a Junior Developer, which I'm determined to do!

## What I'm learning

- I am currently reinforcing my knowledge in REACT and exploring the magic of Next.js.

- For that, I'm practicing in several different ways. One of them is solving FrontendMentor challenges (https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/r-mayer). Other one is creating some personal projects.

- Next step is to start my studies in Typescript, Mongodb and testing frameworks.
